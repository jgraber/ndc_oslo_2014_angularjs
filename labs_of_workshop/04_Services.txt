Lab 04 : Services
Estimated Time: 30 minutes

Continuing from Lab 03. 

Requirements:

1. Remove all $http references from the MovieController. 

2. Add a custom service to the application (MoviesService) that will encapsulate 
communication with the server. The controller should call the service, the service
will use $http to talk to the server and return data using a promise. 

3. The service should also be responsible for caching movies, and update a movie 
with new information by exposing an Update method that will take a movie and copy 
the new data into a cached movie object with the same ID.
