Lab 05 : Directives
Estimated Time: 40 minutes

Continuing from Lab 04. 



Requirements:

1. Add a "rating" data field to each movie, and display the rating in the table as
a series of stars (★★★ for a rating of 3).

2. The rating should use a custom rating directive in the markup.

Example:

<td>
  <div rating rating-value="rating"></div>
<td>

3. Optional bonus! Each time a user clicks on the rating, the rating will increase until
it surpasses 5 stars, at which point the rating will wrap around to 1 star.
