Lab 01 : Introduction to Angular
Estimated Time: 30 minutes

This first lab is intended to get you familar with Angular JS. You'll need to 
implement the following requirements using AngularJS in your development 
environment. 

Requirments:

Write a web page that displays a list of movies to the user. 

Example:

Title         Length     Actions
Star Wars V   120        |+ Length| |- Length|
Star Wars III 120        |+ Length| |- Length|
Star Wars I   120        |+ Length| |- Length|

The |+ Length| and |- Length| text in the example represent buttons, the buttons
should add 1 minute or remove 1 minute from the length of the respective movie. 

You'll need to create a MovieController and use in-memory data (a JavaScript array)
in this example.
