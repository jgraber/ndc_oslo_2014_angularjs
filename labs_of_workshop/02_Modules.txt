Lab 02 : Modules
Estimated Time: 30 minutes

Continuing from Lab 01. 

Requirements:

1. Ensure there are no Angular controllers in the global namespace. You'll need to create a module
for your application and use it with the ngApp directive. You'll also need to register
the MovieController in the application module. 

2. Ensure your script works when minified (use http://jscompress.com/ if you don't have an easier minification tool installed). 

3. New feature - retrieve your movies from a .json file using the $http service directly 
from the controller. The contents will look like the following:

[
    {
        "title": "Indiana Jones", "length": 90
    },
    {
        "title": "Star Wars", "length": 120
    },
    {
        "title": "Hunger Games", "length": 100
    }
]

Note: If using IIS / IIS Express, you might need to add the following to web.config:

  <system.webServer>
    <staticContent>
      <mimeMap fileExtension="json" mimeType="application/json"/>
    </staticContent>
  </system.webServer>
