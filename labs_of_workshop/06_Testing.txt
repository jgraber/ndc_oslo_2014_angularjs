Lab 06 : Testing
Estimated Time: 40 minutes

Continuing from Lab 05. 

Requirements:

Setup Jasmine and Angular mocks so you can write the following tests against
the MovieController.

1. The MovieController should request movie data from the correct server 
endpoint when instantiated. 

2. The MovieController populates a movies member on $scope when the server returns 
movies on a succesful request.
